## Cover Letter
I'm an experienced backend software engineer currently working on the production team at Classy Llama, an ecommerce development agency.  Day to day, I'm building middleware applications for our BigCommerce practice in ExpressJS, wiring together ERP integrations in Celigo or acting as lead developer on our projections modeling in Google Apps Script.  I've even had successs in trying my hand at front end JavaScript devlopment to help a team in need when it was lacking front end resources.  I've become known for my versatility, tenacity and discernment.  

Prior to working in JavaScript in all forms, my expertise was in Scala, writing RESTful API's using Play! Framework and Apache Kafka for Kitestring Technical Services and a fully functional programming stack (http4s, doobie, circe) for Jack Henry's Banno Group.  I cut my teeth on Ruby on Rails and have been building front-ends with ReactJS and TypeScript in my spare time. I studied photography at Missouri State University and have operated a photography and e-commerce businesses.  My wife and I have two boys and a baby girl who was born at the end of March, 2021.

By nature, I collect knowledge and my developer skills are self-taught. Nobody but myself superintended the hours spent every week for my initial education and past employers have entrusted me with a great deal of liberty to use my work-week as I best see fit for the company. Additionally, I especially value taking responsibility for my work and shoddy work will not only reflect poorly on your company, but on my character—something I'm not quick to compromise. My work demonstrates I enjoy learning, am quick to do so, and am capable of meeting the demands of a rapidly changing industry. My background in fine arts helped develop the discipline to tackle problems in innovative ways.  One of the greatest pleasures in my work is to get so caught up in a project that I forget to eat or sleep. My dive into entrepreneurship has given me a special appreciation of business and economics. I care not only about the quality of my work, but knowing it will contribute to the financial success of the company I work for and its clients.

A programming mentor once told me that I ask great questions and those would lead to my success in the industry.  I've adapted quickly to whatever technology was set before me, whether helping to found Classy Llama's NodeJS practice or learning Scala and functional programming on the job at Jack Henry.  I'm excited to apply my learning ability to whatever technology stack I get my hands on in my next position.  In a performance review at Jack Henry, my managers told me that I carried the largest load on the team and led by example, despite being the most junior member.  Wherever I'm next employed, I plan on bringing that same humility to ask a lot of questions and serve my team to the best of my ability by being disciplined and consistent.
